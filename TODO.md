New structure after PWP-UCR reorg
=================================

These are notes of reorganizing the PWP draft. These notes are related to a version of the PWP draft that has already been reduced and changed (in a separate branch) compared to the 'official' document as a result of the earlier work on UCR-s in spring an early summer. But the current UCR reorganization requires an even more thorough change on the PWP draft; this is just first, initial idea.

The proposal is based on the first reorganized version:

done in spring. What is below is, essentially, a table of content with some hints on what the corresponding section contains.
